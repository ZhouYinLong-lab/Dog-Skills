# Dog-Skills

> A collection of Claude skills for AI-assisted development workflows.

Skills are installable prompt bundles for [Claude](https://claude.ai) (Cowork / Claude Code). Each skill teaches Claude a specialized workflow so you don't have to re-explain it every time.

## Skills

### `cc-dispatch` — Codex × Claude Code Collaboration Protocol

**Purpose**: Saves Codex quota by turning the Codex ↔ Claude Code relationship into a structured ticket system rather than a back-and-forth conversation.

**Workflow**:

```
Codex (PM)  ──[Task Package]──▶  Claude Code (Executor)
                                        │
Codex (QA)  ◀──[Completion Report]──────┘
```

Codex acts as product manager: it decomposes requirements into a structured **Task Package** with explicit acceptance criteria and hands it off to Claude Code. Claude Code executes and returns a structured **Completion Report** with per-criterion PASS/FAIL status. Codex reviews the report and either accepts or generates an incremental Change Request.

**Why it saves quota**: Precise task packages mean Claude Code executes correctly on the first attempt — no clarification loops. Structured reports mean Codex verifies acceptance without re-reading all diffs — no unnecessary back-and-forth.

**Key components**:

- **Task Package template** — Task ID, context (file paths, not pasted code), numbered requirements, constraints, verifiable acceptance criteria, test commands
- **Completion Report format** — Status (DONE / PARTIAL / BLOCKED), modified files table, AC checklist with PASS/FAIL, test output, deviations
- **Acceptance framework** — 4-step review checklist, ACCEPT declaration format, Change Request format (incremental, references original Task ID)
- **Quality checklist** — Pre-flight self-check before handing off a task package

**Install**: Download `cc-dispatch.skill` and open it in Claude (Cowork or Claude Code with skills plugin).

## Adding Skills

Each skill lives in its own directory with a `SKILL.md` file. To contribute:

1. Create `your-skill-name/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
2. Package with `python scripts/package_skill.py your-skill-name/`
3. Submit a PR with the directory and the `.skill` file
